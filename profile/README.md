## Hi there 👋 

This organisation is used by GitHub to conduct technical interviews. Perhaps you are interviewing for a possible [role at GitHub](https://github.com/careers), if so good luck 🌈.

We primarily use a tool called [Interview Bot](https://github.com/apps/interview-bot-ng) for setting up the interviews at GitHub, you can read all [about it here](https://github.blog/2022-03-31-how-github-does-take-home-technical-interviews/).

Please reach our to your contact at GitHub if you have any more questions.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
